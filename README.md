# PhaseVocoder

This is a phase vocoder plug-in developed using the JUCE framework. The designers of this plug-in implemented real time pitch shifting to an audio input. To make the effect more interesting, they decided to mix the pitch shifted effect with the original audio to create a harmonizer. The designers believe their harmonizer is an important effect that can be utilized by a wide audience of music producers.
